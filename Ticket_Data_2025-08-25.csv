 Carlos then tweaked it again to give me the needed access.

I gave a family member my phone extension (5103) because the admissions dept is still giving Anisa's old ext (2119) and when he tried calling, a voice message picked up instead of my phone ringing.  However, my phone showed that I had two missed calls, but
 I never left my desk. This is the first time I've been told that direct phone extensions are not connecting. Can you help?
Thank you!

New SUD cirriculum
Good Afternoon!
Attached is a copy of the new SUDS curriculum schedule, broken down by weeks (1-4) with descriptions.
On Wednesdays our process groups are therapist specific, everyone already has one assigned I just need to add ""Process Group Julie"" to Wednesdays as she is a new therapist.
The other days can stay the same with separate process groups for SUD, C1, C2 -like they have been. I also wanted to add two ""breakout groups"" for each day if possible. We can write the description as we go, but
 we have been trying to add groups like yoga, meditation, parenting etc., but we can only do that on certain days when staffing permits.
I know it's a lot of info, so if you have any questions or need to go over anything just reach out. I am in the process of re-organizing our MH curriculum as well, but that can stay the same until I have that completed.
 Any previous SUDS groups can be deleted.
If you just want to let me know whenever you have a chance to complete this I will make sure we are ready to kick it off on our end. Thank you so much Carlos!

It's completely off camera and we have been having issues lately and we need this area covered.
We currently have a camera covering the south exit exterior door but its offline.
It's been installed since IT came out to install the camera's originally & has been offline since then.
Well now we need that camera active along with an additional camera or cameras to cover our backyard.
From what I can see we have about 3 blind spots that can be covered with a few cameras or 2 multi camera units.
Please contact myself, Mark or Lexi about this issue we are having so we can resolve it ASAP.

Question - when did we start changing emails for name changes? Our email addresses are tied to numerous external
 platforms (Salesforce, CTM, UltiPro, etc.), and the last time we did this it caused major issues for a staff member — her linked accounts stopped working because the original email no longer existed and couldn’t be updated.
@Jaiden McEvoy
please confirm if you are having any issues. Help Desk, can someone please ensure that all appropriate accounts are updated with the new email before EOD?
Thank you!

Latest Ticket Update: In terms of charging, the only thing that really damages a battery overtime is having it constantly plugged in all that time. But since these batteries are bad anyways, it shouldn't be too much of an issue.

We are going to be progressively repairing these locally. We can update status as we complete transition through each battery replacement.
The other concern is that typically the iPads never really have the opportunity to fully charge as they are constantly in use. Would that scenario damage the battery in general?

Hey Brent,
If I'm not mistaken, pretty sure we can take those ipads to the same people that we use to repair our ipads to install replacement batteries.
Original Ticket Body
:
Good morning, Help Desk,
We are currently experiencing ongoing issues with iPad's maintaining their battery charge across the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shifts. Several users have reported that iPads are not holding a charge or are not being able to be properly charged
 during their assigned shifts, which is beginning to impact daily operations concerning Round Compliance.
Could you please identify potential remedies to this issue? If additional iPads, battery pack cases, or other solutions are needed, please let us know what options we have.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

 to text"" and then I was able to take my mouse and hold down and highlight text and copy it and it would be saved on my clipboard and I could paste that info into whatever I wanted. It was great and helpful. Today I noticed my computer acting slow, (this happens
 every few days and I have contacted help desk and about 2 months ago they said they would send me out a better computer, I followed up 3x and heard nothing). I restarted my computer to help free some things up and now outlook is doing what it did before a
 month ago and will not covert or allow me to copy test in attachments. I googled it and asked outlook help and could not find a solution all day. Could you look into this?

08/13/2025 16:09 : BHOPB\carlos.rios : Technician : Good afternoon,
At this time, the only area I’m able to assist you with directly is your eRx. As we discussed previously, I’m waiting on confirmation that you’ve completed your enrollment in IDP. Without that step being completed, I’m limited in how I can proceed on my end.
Once you’ve enrolled, please let me know and we can move forward from there.
Best regards,

08/12/2025 18:01 : alloyaircar@gmail.com : Non-Technician : Hi Carlos,
I really don't know how we are ever going to get this done. Either my banyan email and outlook is not set up right or I just don't understand how to organize it. I am overwhelmed by hundreds of birthday emails and can't ever find anything I need in my banyan email. Then, it runs out of space and all my emails bounce. So, I delete a bunch and well, you guessed it, I delete everything that I probably need to see.  I have been waiting for your response and never got it. This is my personal email and I am so glad you sent something to it because .... I got it!. I am only at banyan at certain times and that is the only time I can access my email that I know of. It would really help if someone who knew how to work outlook and all the banyan specific programs could actually meet me and go through all of this. If that can't happen then we need to schedule a time when you can take over my computer and talk me through it. I may have time tomorrow morning but I am also seeing probably 15 patients at banyan virtually tomorrow starting at 9-930. I am going out of town Thursday and will be back Monday afternoon. Please let me know your thoughts.
Thanks so much!
Dr D

After figuring out that being conencted to wifi (BanyanG) is ok, I remoted in to the computer that is always there to test if printing on that computer works. NPRLP08.
Remoting in I see the printer is listed as EPSON4D6E8E.
Trying to do test print it gave paper jam error.
Had Amy clear out paper she was able to find when looking at back but coulnd't print from computer so had her power down the printer and power back on and then try a simple copy to eliminate the PC being the issue and printer jammed just from trying to do a
 copy.
She cannot see any other paper jam.
So told her not a software issue and more hardware so will create ticket so I can see what we need to do.

08/07/2025 16:15 : BHOPB\jscheringer : Technician : graciela and lorraine should be all set once they restart their phones
08/07/2025 16:02 : BHOPB\jscheringer : Technician : i will work on 2 phones now, but the medical director just needs to take the phone from the unused office and move it. this should leave you with an extra phone you can put in that office (swap, basically) or store in the IT closet.
the ""resource nurse"" , nursing has 4 phones already. is a resource nurse part of the nursing group, so we are giving them a 5th phone?
07/29/2025 15:34 : BHOPB\dennis.ewing : Non-Technician : Good Afternoon Ryan,
Thank you for forwarding the below email.
Jared,
Thank you for taking care of Colton's phone. I will check in with him. In regard to the medical director already having a phone assigned (ext. 6062), that is not the medical director's office. It may have been designated for the medical director at some point
 but it is now labeled as Case Manager on the outside of it and truthfully, it sets empty most of the time. The Medical Director uses office 148. That has a new phone in it that has never been used as do the others...

I passed my FNP exam today (I attached the pass report). Can we update my credentials where need be (like my signature on email and my credentials on teams, Kipu, etc.) I will have the license number for HR within a few days. Can we also update my Bio on the
 Banyan website? Abigail I cc'd you as you may tend to that now.  My name should read as Danielle Stevens, MSN. FNP-BC.
The bio update should be as follows:
Danielle Stevens, MSN, FNP-BC, is a proud Florida native, born and raised in Miami. She relocated to Martin County in 1997 and has since dedicated her life to serving individuals facing some of the most complex health challenges, particularly in the fields
 of mental health and substance use.
Danielle’s career in healthcare began as a Behavioral Health Technician (BHT) in an all-male mental health correctional facility. This role sparked her deep commitment to working with underserved populations, especially those struggling with dual diagnoses.
 Determined to make a greater impact, Danielle became a Licensed Practical Nurse and later an RN, gaining hands-on experience in detox and recovery settings.
She joined Banyan in Downtown Stuart as the Director of Nursing for Detox, where she built and led a multidisciplinary nursing team with backgrounds spanning emergency care and behavioral health. Her leadership helped shape a patient-centered and compassionate
 environment designed to support clients throughout every stage of recovery. She now serves as the National Director of Clinical Review, partnering with admissions and clinical teams to ensure that clients receive the timely, medically appropriate care they
 need.
Danielle has recently achieved a major milestone: earning her Master of Science in Nursing and passing her board certification as a Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP-BC). She remains deeply passionate about mental health, addiction medicine, and integrated care,
 with future plans to expand her scope to include functional medicine. Danielle brings not only clinical knowledge but also a deeply personal sense of purpose to every patient interaction, believing in second chances, compassionate care, and the healing power
 of human connection.
Thank you all for your help in advance!

07/24/2025 16:32 : bhopb\cbowra : Technician : Hey Mark,
We actually had your badge printer shipped here before and it always works fine here. The problem is it responds erratically in your environment using a remote process. We troubleshot the connection and network port there but no conclusion was determined. Our plans is to create the same dynamic we use in the IT office by connecting a desktop station directly to the badge printer making the desktop the remote source instead of the printer. We believe that would eliminate the sluggish performance we experience at the Colorado location. We apologize for the delay but the current focus has been the Windows 11 upgrade to replace all desktop units at our older locations before they expire.  We are expecting a shipment of new desktop for the Win11 project but I will pull one to setup for your badge printer. I will keep you updated once we ship it out.
07/24/2025 16:10 : BHOPB\mark.blakeley : Non-Technician : Can I ship the ID badge printer back to someone, and see about getting one that works?

Usually when user logs into their adobe account in the program, the program will prompt to ugrade the program to add the PRO tools but it did not in her case and when I tried under my account it did not either.

You have a license for Adobe but usually when you sign into the program it will see the license and prompt you/me to upgrade the program to Pro tools. But I wasnt able to get it to give me that message to upgrade.
It could be an issue on the Adobe end not pushing the message. It has happened before in my experience with Adobe.
I would recommend for now that you try to see if you can use the tool in the program to edit/fill a form and see if it works. If it doesn't then we'll have to see if later in day or tomorrow when opening Adobe it will prompt to upgrade to pro Tools.

I’ll try my best to get this done next week. Running this cable through the wall and ceiling will be tough, and I’m not sure if it will work due to the cable length. Cables longer than 25 ft can fail with webcams. I ordered the cable and will test it on the computer before attempting the installation.

Detailed description of the Issue: We currently have one BHT Staff Cell phone but are requesting a 2nd one so that there can be one at each property. The phone is used primarily for emergencies with patients, if patients go off property and have to get in contact
 with staff, and for staff to reach out to EC's in the event of a patient emergency. It would be really helpful to have one at each property rather than all the BHTs sharing one phone.

Hey Bubba,
I hope you have had a great week! I wanted to get back to you regarding helping you out with setting up pin printing and seeing if we can service the 3 Epson printers.
Please see the attached word documents for instructions on how to set up pin printing on the device upstairs. Let me know if you have any questions.
Unfortunately, we can't service the Epson printers you have. We do have some devices that could be a good replacement. I'll get you a quote on on 3 new printers to replace them that will print
 in color, can and print on both sides. I'll give you a call next week and we can schedule a time for me to come do a proposal.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Thanks,
Brandon

06/23/2025 14:50 : BHOPB\chivas.johnson : Non-Technician : question: 2
nd
floor printer same computers currently printing to them same as 1st floor printer
some computers are shared but most of them are in offices I hope this helps
If it becomes too much of an issue and we can't do it then (things happen) and they will have to change what they wanted to do.
06/23/2025 14:33 : BHOPB\jscheringer : Technician : unfortunately it's a bit more involved than the guides show
1) how many computers will be printing to (exactly how many printers will be in the open?)
2) how many employees use these computers? I assume some will be shared?
it may not yet be possible to implement this because of the way the computer sends print jobs and also has the printers installed on them, and the need to lock printing to a user code that could change depending on who uses the machine. please start with the above two questions
06/23/2025 12:10 : BHOPB\chivas.johnson : Non-Technician : We are relocating the printers to a common area and the pin code is for HIPPA to prevent staff/clients form seeing client personal information.

Any future camera additions will need licenses and cameras approved, thanks!
05/29/2025 13:48 : BHOPB\chivas.johnson : Non-Technician : camera in box MAC:E4F14C436B60 (NOT USED YET)
2F CLINICAL SUPPORT I removed the camera by unplugging it but will be reusing it for the exterior of that same room, that room is being changed to Maintenance Office
that Mac address is :E4F14C436B59
05/29/2025 08:49 : BHOPB\chivas.johnson : Non-Technician : sorry Please give me call I am not 100% sure on the answer when i can speak with someone to confirm what we have done and what is left.
Thanks,
Bubba
05/28/2025 15:55 : BHOPB\jscheringer : Technician : please advise if you agree these will be the last 5 licenses ordered to complete the camera project
05/28/2025 12:50 : BHOPB\jscheringer : Technician : ok we will resolve 1f Clinical support as 1 of the 3 cameras to tone out when you can. please provide the mac address of
a) the camera new in box
b) the camera from 2F Clinical Support
i can keep track of them for licensing that way, but looks like those 2 plus 2f laundry room makes 3 plus Room 126 and Room 244 makes 5 total new license we will need. 1F Clinical though offline, is using a license so won't need one
05/27/2025 13:10 : BHOPB\chivas.johnson : Non-Technician : I have 1 camera not installed yet and still in the box and 1 camera removed from an office room (clinical support 2nd floor). That camera will either do into the large group room, dishwasher area, or another office space.
I do have a camera that was in a clinical support room on the 2nd floor that is currently disconnected because that office is now a storage room so we will be moving that camera into the case manager office at some point. With that being said in the end after
 that move I will have 1 camera still in the box waiting for the location to install it.
I know some staff would like one in their office to protect them just in case.
05/27/2025 13:06 : BHOPB\chivas.johnson : Non-Technician : for the group room C the name of the room was changed to Clinical Support
the camera that is offline I believe was could had been moved or disconnected and reconnected later due to at one time the ED didn't want the camera in the meeting room so we moved it and later that meeting room is now a group room. I hope that helps, it still
 shows up as offline I don't know why.
The switch port tracking will be a little while since I have a lot of work to do before my vacation next week.
05/27/2025 11:54 : BHOPB\jscheringer : Technician : also regarding licensing, have you mounted all of the intended cameras as listed here? we need an accurate count to get approval for any further licenses beyond the 83 you are using (this 83 does not count the previously mentioned 4 offline cameras and 1 online but not yet recording\licensed)
05/27/2025 11:49 : BHOPB\jscheringer : Technician : the majority of the cameras were added with the following
exceptions
:
1F - Clinical Support  MAC:E4F14C436D0B - this is previously listed as 1F Group Room C,
was it moved?
Medical Provider Room 126   MAC:E4F14C436D6D
Bio Bed Room #244    MAC:E4F14C436B6A
Please test runs to switches and let me know which switches and ports they are in
Of the cameras added only 1 is not recording - 2F Laundry Room, because we ran out of licenses
Also while on the cameras, please provide a status for the following camera which is offline, was it removed and shelved, moved to a new location, or unexpectedly offline in the current location?

Main reason being is we are trying to add a code to the printer to have everyone sign in before the printer actually prints (for HIPPA). We are moving the printer from the printer office
 into the public area yet we want it to not print until the staff member(s) are there to make to the printer print instead. This way no paperwork is just sitting there and the staff member won't forget they have paperwork waiting for them. I hope this makes
 sense please let me know what you need from me to make this happen.

I hope you're doing well!
Would it be possible to set up a dedicated team number for the marketing department to use for 2FA? Currently, the numbers are assigned to individual team members, such as Alyssa, which can create inconsistencies and potential access issues in the future.
Ideally, we’d like to have a unified number that all team members can use for authentication purposes. Would it be possible to create a Teams number and a corresponding Teams group where 2FA messages could be received? Or do you have any recommendations for
 the best way to ensure the department has a single, accessible number for receiving authentication texts?
Thanks in advance for your help! Looking forward to your guidance.

Banyan Boca is having issues with all of our iPads. Our iPads our kicking out our Tech constantly and this is obviously an issue when attempting to complete rounds, intakes, log personals, etc. It is not saving their work either. As you can imagine, it also
 makes them log back in each time, with can be annoying. I know that apple allows for them to save their information, but I have directed them not to do that as their peers will login and do work under each others names with is inappropriate.
I spoke with Don and he said he can come by on Wednesday the 29
th
and reset the iPads for us to hopefully help with this issue.
Also,
We need to clarify with iPads are Data and register the second line for Data here at Boca. I am aware the the iPad 01746 is Data and is active but you guys on your end have 01747 as Data. I cannot locate that iPad on property. We can benefit from another Data
 iPad here.
Please clarify when you can.

But first I need to check our system to see how many iPads are already assigned to her location and told her I would work on it.
01/29/2025 08:21 : BHOPB\dmui : Technician : Have already had discussion with Christina regarding iPads and sent Teams message this morning. Plan to stop by Boca Detox to look at any iPads available at time. Probably around 1pm.
If you can please make sure iPads are charged before gathering them.

05/07/2025 15:04 : bhopb\cbowra : Technician : Hey Allia,
I would like to run the cable concealer in your office if available.
We would like to use the a Bluetooth speaker for this process. Unfortunately we can only use a 1 speaker system for the Bluetooth function. I provided a recommended speaker but you are more than welcome to order the JBL as well. I found a different landing place for the speakers to keep it away from outside source. I will place it above the wood panel at the front desk and run cable behind and down to the front desk level. Please order when you can.
