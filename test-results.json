        "Ticket_Body": "I get faxes and before last month I was unable to copy and paste straight from the preview. I don't know how it happened but about a month age I would open my fax emails and click the attachment and in the bottom left corner it would say something like \"coverting\r\n to text\" and then I was able to take my mouse and hold down and highlight text and copy it and it would be saved on my clipboard and I could paste that info into whatever I wanted. It was great and helpful. Today I noticed my computer acting slow, (this happens\r\n every few days and I have contacted help desk and about 2 months ago they said they would send me out a better computer, I followed up 3x and heard nothing). I restarted my computer to help free some things up and now outlook is doing what it did before a\r\n month ago and will not covert or allow me to copy test in attachments. I googled it and asked outlook help and could not find a solution all day. Could you look into this?\nJoseph Gomez\nUtilization Review Specialist\nOffice hours 6:00am- 2:30pm\nPlease allow 24hrs for a response\nPhone:\n(772) 206-0350\nFax:\n(954) 379-4600\njoseph.gomez@banyancenters.com\nwww.banyantreatmentcenters.com\n• Pompano Beach • Florida • 33062\nThe information contained in this transmission may contain privileged and confidential information, including patient information protected by federal and state privacy laws.

Either my banyan email and outlook is not set up right or I just don't understand how to organize it. I am overwhelmed by hundreds of birthday emails and can't ever find anything I need in my banyan email. Then, it runs out of space and all my emails bounce. So, I delete a bunch and well, you guessed it, I delete everything that I probably need to see.  I have been waiting for your response and never got it. This is my personal email and I am so glad you sent something to it because .... I got it!. I am only at banyan at certain times and that is the only time I can access my email that I know of. It would really help if someone who knew how to work outlook and all the banyan specific programs could actually meet me and go through all of this. If that can't happen then we need to schedule a time when you can take over my computer and talk me through it. I may have time tomorrow morning but I am also seeing probably 15 patients at banyan virtually tomorrow starting at 9-930. I am going out of town Thursday and will be back Monday afternoon. Please let me know your thoughts.\nThanks so much!\nDr D\n08/12/2025 16:14 : BHOPB\\carlos.rios : Technician : Good morning,\nYour request has been completed.

FNP-BC.\nThe bio update should be as follows:\nDanielle Stevens, MSN, FNP-BC, is a proud Florida native, born and raised in Miami. She relocated to Martin County in 1997 and has since dedicated her life to serving individuals facing some of the most complex health challenges, particularly in the fields\r\n of mental health and substance use.\nDanielle’s career in healthcare began as a Behavioral Health Technician (BHT) in an all-male mental health correctional facility. This role sparked her deep commitment to working with underserved populations, especially those struggling with dual diagnoses.\r\n Determined to make a greater impact, Danielle became a Licensed Practical Nurse and later an RN, gaining hands-on experience in detox and recovery settings.\nShe joined Banyan in Downtown Stuart as the Director of Nursing for Detox, where she built and led a multidisciplinary nursing team with backgrounds spanning emergency care and behavioral health. Her leadership helped shape a patient-centered and compassionate\r\n environment designed to support clients throughout every stage of recovery. She now serves as the National Director of Clinical Review, partnering with admissions and clinical teams to ensure that clients receive the timely, medically appropriate care they\r\n need.\nDanielle has recently achieved a major milestone: earning her Master of Science in Nursing and passing her board certification as a Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP-BC). She remains deeply passionate about mental health, addiction medicine, and integrated care,\r\n with future plans to expand her scope to include functional medicine. Danielle brings not only clinical knowledge but also a deeply personal sense of purpose to every patient interaction, believing in second chances, compassionate care, and the healing power\r\n of human connection.\nThank you all for your help in advance!\nDanielle\nDanielle Stevens MSN, RN\nNational Director of Clinical Review\nPhone:\n(772) 200-4411 x302\nMobile:\n(772) 634-6783\nFax:\n(772) 324-6455\ndmenendez@banyancenters.com\nwww.banyantreatmentcenters.com\n201 SE Osceola St\nStuart FL 34994\nThe information contained in this transmission may contain privileged and confidential information, including patient information protected by federal and state privacy laws.

Can we update my credentials where need be (like my signature on email and my credentials on teams, Kipu, etc.) I will have the license number for HR within a few days. Can we also update my Bio on the\r\n Banyan website? Abigail I cc'd you as you may tend to that now.  My name should read as Danielle Stevens, MSN. FNP-BC.\nThe bio update should be as follows:\nDanielle Stevens, MSN, FNP-BC, is a proud Florida native, born and raised in Miami. She relocated to Martin County in 1997 and has since dedicated her life to serving individuals facing some of the most complex health challenges, particularly in the fields\r\n of mental health and substance use.\nDanielle’s career in healthcare began as a Behavioral Health Technician (BHT) in an all-male mental health correctional facility. This role sparked her deep commitment to working with underserved populations, especially those struggling with dual diagnoses.\r\n Determined to make a greater impact, Danielle became a Licensed Practical Nurse and later an RN, gaining hands-on experience in detox and recovery settings.\nShe joined Banyan in Downtown Stuart as the Director of Nursing for Detox, where she built and led a multidisciplinary nursing team with backgrounds spanning emergency care and behavioral health. Her leadership helped shape a patient-centered and compassionate\r\n environment designed to support clients throughout every stage of recovery. She now serves as the National Director of Clinical Review, partnering with admissions and clinical teams to ensure that clients receive the timely, medically appropriate care they\r\n need.\nDanielle has recently achieved a major milestone: earning her Master of Science in Nursing and passing her board certification as a Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP-BC). She remains deeply passionate about mental health, addiction medicine, and integrated care,\r\n with future plans to expand her scope to include functional medicine. Danielle brings not only clinical knowledge but also a deeply personal sense of purpose to every patient interaction, believing in second chances, compassionate care, and the healing power\r\n of human connection.\nThank you all for your help in advance!\nDanielle\n<ANCC PASS REPORT.pdf>\n07/19/2025 15:09 : dmenendez@banyancenters.com : Non-Technician : New ticket submitted via\nEmail",

The problem is it responds erratically in your environment using a remote process. We troubleshot the connection and network port there but no conclusion was determined. Our plans is to create the same dynamic we use in the IT office by connecting a desktop station directly to the badge printer making the desktop the remote source instead of the printer. We believe that would eliminate the sluggish performance we experience at the Colorado location. We apologize for the delay but the current focus has been the Windows 11 upgrade to replace all desktop units at our older locations before they expire.  We are expecting a shipment of new desktop for the Win11 project but I will pull one to setup for your badge printer. I will keep you updated once we ship it out.\n07/24/2025 16:10 : BHOPB\\mark.blakeley : Non-Technician : Can I ship the ID badge printer back to someone, and see about getting one that works?\nMark Blakeley, MS, LAC, LPC, CSAT\nExecutive Clinical Director\nPhone:\n(303) 381-8340\nmark.blakeley@banyancenters.com\nwww.banyantreatmentcenters.com\n1055 S.

Our iPads our kicking out our Tech constantly and this is obviously an issue when attempting to complete rounds, intakes, log personals, etc. It is not saving their work either. As you can imagine, it also\r\n makes them log back in each time, with can be annoying. I know that apple allows for them to save their information, but I have directed them not to do that as their peers will login and do work under each others names with is inappropriate.\nI spoke with Don and he said he can come by on Wednesday the 29\nth\nand reset the iPads for us to hopefully help with this issue.\nAlso,\nWe need to clarify with iPads are Data and register the second line for Data here at Boca. I am aware the the iPad 01746 is Data and is active but you guys on your end have 01747 as Data. I cannot locate that iPad on property. We can benefit from another Data\r\n iPad here.\nPlease clarify when you can.\nThank you as always!\nChristina Vespucci, B.A\nDirector of Operations\nPhone:\n(954) 533-7705 x511\nFax:\n(561) 409-4920\ncvespucci@banyancenters.com\nwww.banyantreatmentcenters.com\n1000 NW 15th St\nBoca Raton FL 33486\nThe information contained in this transmission may contain privileged and confidential information, including patient information protected by federal and state privacy laws.

I also wanted to add two \"breakout groups\" for each day if possible. We can write the description as we go, but\r\n we have been trying to add groups like yoga, meditation, parenting etc., but we can only do that on certain days when staffing permits.\nI know it's a lot of info, so if you have any questions or need to go over anything just reach out. I am in the process of re-organizing our MH curriculum as well, but that can stay the same until I have that completed.\r\n Any previous SUDS groups can be deleted.\nIf you just want to let me know whenever you have a chance to complete this I will make sure we are ready to kick it off on our end. Thank you so much Carlos!\nTricia\nBanyan Clearbrook MA\nSUDS\r\n cirriculum breakdown.docx\n-\n-\nCarlos Rios\nApplication Analyst\nPhone:\nEmail:\ncarlos.rios@banyancenters.com\n,\nThe information contained in this transmission may contain privileged and confidential information and is property of Banyan Treatment Centers, including patient information protected by federal and state privacy laws.

        "Ticket_Body": "I get faxes and before last month I was unable to copy and paste straight from the preview. I don't know how it happened but about a month age I would open my fax emails and click the attachment and in the bottom left corner it would say something like \"coverting\r\n to text\" and then I was able to take my mouse and hold down and highlight text and copy it and it would be saved on my clipboard and I could paste that info into whatever I wanted. It was great and helpful. Today I noticed my computer acting slow, (this happens\r\n every few days and I have contacted help desk and about 2 months ago they said they would send me out a better computer, I followed up 3x and heard nothing). I restarted my computer to help free some things up and now outlook is doing what it did before a\r\n month ago and will not covert or allow me to copy test in attachments. I googled it and asked outlook help and could not find a solution all day.

Either my banyan email and outlook is not set up right or I just don't understand how to organize it. I am overwhelmed by hundreds of birthday emails and can't ever find anything I need in my banyan email. Then, it runs out of space and all my emails bounce. So, I delete a bunch and well, you guessed it, I delete everything that I probably need to see.  I have been waiting for your response and never got it. This is my personal email and I am so glad you sent something to it because .... I got it!. I am only at banyan at certain times and that is the only time I can access my email that I know of. It would really help if someone who knew how to work outlook and all the banyan specific programs could actually meet me and go through all of this. If that can't happen then we need to schedule a time when you can take over my computer and talk me through it. I may have time tomorrow morning but I am also seeing probably 15 patients at banyan virtually tomorrow starting at 9-930. I am going out of town Thursday and will be back Monday afternoon. Please let me know your thoughts.\nThanks so much!\nDr D\n08/12/2025 16:14 : BHOPB\\carlos.rios : Technician : Good morning,\nYour request has been completed.

FNP-BC.\nThe bio update should be as follows:\nDanielle Stevens, MSN, FNP-BC, is a proud Florida native, born and raised in Miami. She relocated to Martin County in 1997 and has since dedicated her life to serving individuals facing some of the most complex health challenges, particularly in the fields\r\n of mental health and substance use.\nDanielle’s career in healthcare began as a Behavioral Health Technician (BHT) in an all-male mental health correctional facility. This role sparked her deep commitment to working with underserved populations, especially those struggling with dual diagnoses.\r\n Determined to make a greater impact, Danielle became a Licensed Practical Nurse and later an RN, gaining hands-on experience in detox and recovery settings.\nShe joined Banyan in Downtown Stuart as the Director of Nursing for Detox, where she built and led a multidisciplinary nursing team with backgrounds spanning emergency care and behavioral health. Her leadership helped shape a patient-centered and compassionate\r\n environment designed to support clients throughout every stage of recovery. She now serves as the National Director of Clinical Review, partnering with admissions and clinical teams to ensure that clients receive the timely, medically appropriate care they\r\n need.\nDanielle has recently achieved a major milestone: earning her Master of Science in Nursing and passing her board certification as a Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP-BC). She remains deeply passionate about mental health, addiction medicine, and integrated care,\r\n with future plans to expand her scope to include functional medicine. Danielle brings not only clinical knowledge but also a deeply personal sense of purpose to every patient interaction, believing in second chances, compassionate care, and the healing power\r\n of human connection.\nThank you all for your help in advance!\nDanielle\nDanielle Stevens MSN, RN\nNational Director of Clinical Review\nPhone:\n(772) 200-4411 x302\nMobile:\n(772) 634-6783\nFax:\n(772) 324-6455\ndmenendez@banyancenters.com\nwww.banyantreatmentcenters.com\n201 SE Osceola St\nStuart FL 34994\nThe information contained in this transmission may contain privileged and confidential information, including patient information protected by federal and state privacy laws.

The problem is it responds erratically in your environment using a remote process. We troubleshot the connection and network port there but no conclusion was determined. Our plans is to create the same dynamic we use in the IT office by connecting a desktop station directly to the badge printer making the desktop the remote source instead of the printer. We believe that would eliminate the sluggish performance we experience at the Colorado location. We apologize for the delay but the current focus has been the Windows 11 upgrade to replace all desktop units at our older locations before they expire.  We are expecting a shipment of new desktop for the Win11 project but I will pull one to setup for your badge printer. I will keep you updated once we ship it out.\n07/24/2025 16:10 : BHOPB\\mark.blakeley : Non-Technician : Can I ship the ID badge printer back to someone, and see about getting one that works?\nMark Blakeley, MS, LAC, LPC, CSAT\nExecutive Clinical Director\nPhone:\n(303) 381-8340\nmark.blakeley@banyancenters.com\nwww.banyantreatmentcenters.com\n1055 S.

        "Ticket_Body": "Hi team,\nI hope you're doing well!\nWould it be possible to set up a dedicated team number for the marketing department to use for 2FA? Currently, the numbers are assigned to individual team members, such as Alyssa, which can create inconsistencies and potential access issues in the future.\nIdeally, we’d like to have a unified number that all team members can use for authentication purposes. Would it be possible to create a Teams number and a corresponding Teams group where 2FA messages could be received? Or do you have any recommendations for\r\n the best way to ensure the department has a single, accessible number for receiving authentication texts?\nThanks in advance for your help! Looking forward to your guidance.\n-\nKaitlin Jones\nDigital Marketing Specialist\nPhone:\nEmail:\nkaitlin.jones@banyancenters.com\n,\nThe information contained in this transmission may contain privileged and confidential information and is property of Banyan Treatment Centers, including patient information protected by federal and state privacy laws.

I know that apple allows for them to save their information, but I have directed them not to do that as their peers will login and do work under each others names with is inappropriate.\nI spoke with Don and he said he can come by on Wednesday the 29\nth\nand reset the iPads for us to hopefully help with this issue.\nAlso,\nWe need to clarify with iPads are Data and register the second line for Data here at Boca. I am aware the the iPad 01746 is Data and is active but you guys on your end have 01747 as Data. I cannot locate that iPad on property.
